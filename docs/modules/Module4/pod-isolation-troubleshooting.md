## Troubleshooting POD Scheduling problems

1. Check Pod Status and Events:

    - Use kubectl get pods to check if the pod is in a Pending, Running, or Error state.
    - Use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to view events and messages related to scheduling issues.
    - Examine the namespace pods to check for scheduling errors

2. Review Taints and Tolerations:

    - Nodes might have taints applied that prevent pods from being scheduled unless the pod has a matching toleration. U
    
3. list taints on nodes.
    - Ensure your pod specs include the necessary tolerations for the taints present on your target nodes.

4. Verify Resource Requests and Limits:

    - Ensure the pod's resource requests and limits are within the capacity of your nodes. Pods might not be scheduled if they request more resources than any node can offer.
    - Compare the pod's resource requests to the node capacities using kubectl describe nodes.

5. Check Affinity and Anti-Affinity Rules:

    - Review the pod's affinity and anti-affinity rules to ensure they're not overly restrictive or misconfigured, preventing the pod from being scheduled.
    - Pay special attention to requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution and preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution specifications.

6. Inspect Node Selector and Node Affinity:

    - Pods might have node selector or node affinity rules that limit the nodes they can be scheduled on. Verify these rules match the labels of available nodes.
    - Use kubectl get nodes --show-labels to see node labels and ensure they align with your pod's scheduling requirements.
